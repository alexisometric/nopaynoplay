## ✨ What is it for?

You self-host Jellyfin for your family / friends / housemates and you'd like them to chip in for the bills — without plugging in Stripe, opening a company and spending Friday nights chasing payments on WhatsApp.

**NoPayNoPlay** automates the tedious parts:

- 📅 keeps track of who owes what and when,
- 🔔 reminds users a few days before expiry via the Jellyfin notification bell,
- 🚫 **disables playback** (but never the account) on expiry,
- ✅ you validate payments manually when the money lands on PayPal / Lydia / your bank account,
- 🆓 free 7-day trial on every new account,
- 🎁 manual exemption for family / VIP guests.

It is designed to be **simple, transparent and reversible**: no external database, no outbound calls, everything lives in Jellyfin's standard XML configuration.

---

## 🌍 Localization

The plugin is **English-first** with a built-in i18n system.

- Translation bundles are embedded JSON resources (`src/Localization/strings.{lang}.json`).
- The active language is resolved from (in order): admin override (`UiCultureOverride` setting) → `?lang=` query → `Accept-Language` header → **Jellyfin server UI culture** → `en` fallback.
- Bundled languages: **English** (`en`), **French** (`fr`).
- Adding a new language is just dropping a new `strings.{code}.json` next to the others and listing it as an `EmbeddedResource` in the csproj.

## 📦 Installation (recommended)

### 1. Add the repository in Jellyfin

**Dashboard → Plugins → Repositories → ➕**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | `NoPayNoPlay` |
| **URL** | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexisometric/nopaynoplay/main/manifest.json` |

### 2. Install the plugin

**Catalog → NoPayNoPlay → Install**, then restart Jellyfin.

### 3. (Recommended) Install the companion plugin

The user-facing UI (header button, banner, modal) is injected through [**File Transformation**](https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-file-transformation) — the official mechanism to safely modify `index.html`. Without it, the plugin still works but the user UI does not appear.

### 4. Configure

**Dashboard → Plugins → NoPayNoPlay**:

- monthly price, currency, grace days, trial days, warning days;
- PayPal.me, Lydia and IBAN links, free-form note;
- per-user view with quick actions.

## 🧠 How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User signs in] -->|Jellyfin event| B(SubscriptionService)
    B -->|new account| C[7-day trial]
    D[Scheduled task 12h] --> E{State}
    E -->|warning| F[Notification bell]
    E -->|expired + grace| G[UserPolicyEnforcer<br/>disables playback]
    H[Admin records payment] --> B
    B --> I[(Jellyfin XML config<br/>+ backups)]
```

- **No external database.** Everything is serialized in the Jellyfin plugin XML configuration.
- **Reversible.** Before blocking a user, their `UserPolicy` is snapshotted. Removing the block restores it as-is.
- **Anti-spam.** A notification is only sent once per state change.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Does the plugin delete accounts?</b></summary>

No. Never. On expiry, only the playback permissions (`EnableMediaPlayback`, transcoding…) are set to `false`. The original policy is snapshotted and restored when the user is unblocked.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What happens if I uninstall the plugin while a user is blocked?</b></summary>

Their `UserPolicy` stays in the modified state. **Make sure to unblock everyone before uninstalling** (Reset or Exempt button).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if the server is offline for several days?</b></summary>

The scheduled task runs every 12 h; on next startup it catches up. No data is lost.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I change the price without breaking active subscriptions?</b></summary>

Yes. The price is read at the time a payment is recorded. Already-computed expiries do not move.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is it compatible with Jellyfin 10.10?</b></summary>

No, the API has changed. This release targets Jellyfin **10.11.x** (`targetAbi` 10.11.8.0).
</details>
